  <abstract>This data set represents the geographic extent of the Great Salt Lake shoreline varying water levels.

To show the geographic extent of the Great Salt Lake shoreline varying water levels.

The elevations (expressed in feet) represented are 4200, 4209, 4212 and 4218. Two data sources were combined into this data set, a USGS paper map and Utah Water Resources remotely sensed imagery. Processing data archived at the AGRC can derive other water levels.</abstract>
